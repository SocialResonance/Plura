# Plura

**Collaborative document editing powered by community wisdom**



## What is Plura?

Plura is a NextCloud app that reimagines collaborative document editing through the lens of Plural Management. Instead of relying on rigid hierarchies or chaotic free-for-alls, Plura creates a merit-based system where influence is earned through contributions and community alignment.

## How It Works

Plura introduces a two-stage approach to document editing:

### 1. Edit Proposal: Identifying What Needs Changing

- Anyone can propose an "Edit proposal" â€“ a description of what should be changed in a document
- Community members allocate "management credits" to proposal they find important
- The more support an proposal receives, the higher its priority
- Popular proposal attract more attention and implementation efforts

### 2. Edit Implementation: Proposing Concrete Changes

- Users can create an "Edit Implementation" that address specific proposal
- Multiple implementations can be proposed for a single proposal
- The community votes to approve or reject each implementation
- When approved, the implementation is applied and the contributor is rewarded

## The Credit System

Plura uses a virtual credit system to measure and reward participation:

- **Earning credits**: 
  - Submit implementations that get approved
  - Correctly predict voting outcomes
  - Initial credits are provided to new users

- **Spending credits**:
  - Fund edit proposal you find important
  - Vote on proposed implementations
  - Predict vote outcomes (which can earn you more credits)
