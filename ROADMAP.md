   - Develop initial credit allocation for new users

3. **System Parameter Management**
   - Build admin parameter storage (plura_admin_parameters table)
   - Implement configuration UI for administrators
   - Create system for parameter validation and update tracking

4. **Matching Fund Management**
   - Implement matching fund storage (plura_matching_fund table)
   - Create mechanisms for fund replenishment
   - Develop allocation algorithms for matching fund distribution

## Phase 2: Proposal System

5. **Proposal Creation and Management**
   - Implement proposal creation UI/UX
